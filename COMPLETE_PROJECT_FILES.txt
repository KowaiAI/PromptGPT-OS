- **Professional prompt templates** for each content type
- **Rich colorful terminal interface** with ASCII art
- **Interactive navigation** with keyboard shortcuts
- **File saving functionality** for generated prompts
- **Cross-platform support** (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip package manager

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Download Project Files**
   - Download the `COMPLETE_PROJECT_FILES.txt`
   - Extract all files according to the directory structure below

2. **Create Directory Structure**
   ```
   promptgpt_os/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project_requirements.txt
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ settings.py
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ questions.json
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates.json
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ display.py
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ navigation.py
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prompt_generator.py
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ file_handler.py
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ generated_prompts/    (will be auto-created)
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Using pip directly
   pip install rich keyboard
   
   # Option 2: Using requirements file
   pip install -r project_requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   cd promptgpt_os
   python main.py
   ```

### Troubleshooting Installation
- Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed: `python --version`
- If pip is not found, install it first
- For permission issues on macOS/Linux, try: `pip install --user rich keyboard`
- On Windows, you may need to run as administrator

## üí° Best Practices for Maximum Prompt Quality

### üéØ Answer Strategy
- **NEVER use yes/no answers** - Always provide detailed, comprehensive responses
- **The more detail you provide, the better your prompt will be**
- **Elaborate on every aspect** of your requirements and preferences
- **Include examples** when possible to clarify your needs

### üìù Detailed Answering Guidelines

**Instead of:** "Yes, I need user authentication"
**Use:** "I need a robust user authentication system with email/password login, social media OAuth (Google, Facebook), password reset functionality, email verification, session management, and role-based access control for admin, moderator, and regular user roles."

**Instead of:** "Modern design"
**Use:** "I want a clean, minimalist design following Material Design principles with a blue and white color scheme, sans-serif typography (like Inter or Roboto), subtle shadows, rounded corners, and smooth animations. The design should feel professional yet approachable, similar to modern SaaS applications like Slack or Notion."

### üîç Comprehensive Response Framework

1. **Context & Purpose**
   - Explain the broader context of your project
   - Define your target audience demographics and technical skill level
   - Describe the problem you're solving

2. **Specific Requirements**
   - List all functional requirements in detail
   - Specify technical constraints and preferences
   - Include performance and scalability needs

3. **Style & Preferences**
   - Describe visual style, tone, or aesthetic preferences
   - Mention any brand guidelines or existing standards
   - Reference examples or inspirations

4. **Technical Details**
   - Specify frameworks, languages, or tools you prefer
   - Include integration requirements with other systems
   - Mention hosting, deployment, or platform constraints

5. **Success Criteria**
   - Define what success looks like for your project
   - Include measurable goals or outcomes
   - Specify any compliance or accessibility requirements

### ‚úÖ Quality Checklist for Each Answer

Before submitting each response, ask yourself:
- [ ] Did I provide specific examples?
- [ ] Did I explain the "why" behind my requirements?
- [ ] Did I include enough detail for someone unfamiliar with my project?
- [ ] Did I mention my target audience and their needs?
- [ ] Did I specify any constraints or limitations?
- [ ] Could I add more context or background information?

### üöÄ Pro Tips for Better Prompts

- **Reference Examples**: Mention specific websites, apps, or designs you admire
- **Include User Stories**: Describe how users will interact with your content
- **Specify Edge Cases**: Mention special situations or requirements
- **Provide Context**: Explain why certain features or styles are important
- **Think Long-term**: Consider future needs and scalability
- **Be Honest About Constraints**: Mention budget, timeline, or technical limitations
